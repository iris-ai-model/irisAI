Iris: A Real-Time AI Learning System for the Solana Blockchain
Overview
Iris is an advanced artificial intelligence system designed to learn in real-time from the Solana blockchain. Iris processes blockchain transactions, learns from the data, and grows exponentially as more data is collected. Its ultimate goal is to make accurate market predictions and execute perfect trades based on its understanding of blockchain activity.

As Iris processes more transactions, it gains the ability to predict coin prices and market trends with increasing accuracy. Every 1000 transactions, Iris expands its capacity by utilizing more RPC nodes, enhancing its ability to analyze and learn from larger datasets.

Key Features

Real-Time Learning: Iris learns continuously from the Solana blockchain, processing transactions and using them to improve its predictive capabilities.
Exponential Growth: Every 1000 transactions, Iris scales its learning system by integrating additional RPC nodes, enabling the model to grow its knowledge base exponentially.

Blockchain Data Integration: Iris directly interfaces with the Solana blockchain using RPC nodes to fetch transaction, block, and account data.
Market Prediction: Iris aims to predict market trends, including cryptocurrency prices, transaction volumes, and trading opportunities, based on real-time blockchain data.

AI-Powered Trading: With accurate market predictions, Iris will be able to make autonomous, high-precision trades (planned feature).
Scalable & Adaptive: As more data is processed, Irisâ€™s learning algorithm adapts, improving over time. It is designed to become smarter and more accurate as it learns from the blockchain.

Architecture
Iris is built using a modular and scalable architecture, divided into several components:

Data Collection:

The BlockchainConnector and RPCConnector are responsible for fetching and streaming blockchain data from Solana.
Learning Model:

The IrisModel uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the data, detect patterns, and learn from blockchain transactions over time.
Prediction Engine:

Iris processes the data to make predictions about future market movements and coin prices.
Automated Trading (future feature):

Based on its predictions, Iris will eventually be able to execute automated trades in decentralized exchanges or other blockchain-based platforms.
Scalability:

Iris grows exponentially as it processes more transactions. The system increases its learning capacity every 1000 transactions by utilizing additional RPC nodes, improving its ability to handle larger datasets.
How Iris Works

1. Data Collection
Iris collects real-time data from the Solana blockchain. The BlockchainConnector and RPCConnector are the main components responsible for gathering blockchain data.

BlockchainConnector: Fetches transaction data and block information from the Solana network. It uses the RPC API to interact with Solana's endpoints.
RPCConnector: Handles communication with the Solana RPC API to fetch data about transactions, account balances, blocks, and more.
Every 1000 transactions, Iris adds additional RPC nodes to increase its data processing capacity. This expansion allows Iris to scale its learning capabilities exponentially.

python
Copy code
from src.blockchain_connector import BlockchainConnector

connector = BlockchainConnector()
transactions = connector.fetch_recent_transactions()
2. Learning Process
Once Iris collects data, it feeds it into the IrisModel, which is responsible for learning from the transactions. Iris uses machine learning models to analyze transaction patterns, detect correlations, and build a model that can predict future events in the blockchain ecosystem.

After every 1000 transactions, Iris dynamically adds more RPC nodes, boosting its learning ability and allowing it to process larger datasets.

python
Copy code
from src.iris_model import IrisModel

model = IrisModel()
model.learn_from_transactions(transactions)

3. Market Prediction
Iris uses its trained model to analyze patterns in the blockchain data and generate predictions about market trends and coin prices. By recognizing patterns in the data, Iris can make informed predictions on how the market will move.

Example:

python
Copy code
predictions = model.predict_market_trends()
print("Market Predictions: ", predictions)
The predictions can include:

Price trends for Solana (SOL) or other tokens.
Market movements based on transaction patterns.
Insights into large wallet activities and their potential impact on prices.

4. Trading Execution (Future Feature)
In future versions of Iris, once market predictions are made, the system will automatically execute trades based on the predictions. These trades will be made through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or other smart contract platforms, aiming for high-profit trades based on predictive models.
